                    Active Garden is a networked technology consisting of a mobile application and an automatic watering system that 
                    encourages the elderly to keep fit and maintain their plants. Users complete at-home workouts and are rewarded with 
                    their plants being watered. Workouts are customisable, and plants are registered within the app, where the correct 
                    measure of water is inputted for each individual plant. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    The aim of this project was to design a product that promotes the concept of active aging to the elderly through 
                    networked technologies. In doing so, such individuals maintain positive health, participation, and security in their 
                    daily life, which is integral to leading a fulfilling and enjoyable lifestyle in elderhood. Within the scope of this 
                    project, it was required that a combination of two networked technologies were to be used to address the problem statement. 
                    Only one device/user interface was required to be focused on when prototyping, with the general concept of how it will 
                    communicate and connect with the second device being mandatory to be explored. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    With a team of four members, I participated in conducting interviews to gather user research, creating a storyboard, 
                    a paper prototype and a high-fidelity prototype of the design idea, as well as guiding a participant through user testing 
                    evaluation.

                        With this user research, it was decided that the proposed technology for active aging would revolve around gardening due to 
                        its involvement in the majority of elderly lives, as well as incorporating physical activity to tackle long-term health
                        concerns.

                    To better visualise and understand how the proposed technology will be used in the context of an eldery person's home, I 
                    created a storyboard that depicts a typical interaction with Active Garden. By visually sharing a hypothetical situation of 
                    the target audience, the team was able to share a common understanding of how the technology would function and its design
                    directions.

                    With the target audience being elderly people, it was essential that the technology was designed in a manner that 
                    was easy to learn. With this in mind, many of the elements within the prototypes are consistent with the user interfaces
                    of many other applications, with a specific focus on utilising icons and visual cues to interact with the app.

                    Various usability testing was conducted to obtain feedback and improve upon each iteration of the technology's prototypes. 
                    Such testing includes heuristic evaluation, where the participant was given the task of completing a workout and 
                    watering their plants using Active Garden. Information that was recorded includes usability assessment (positive/ negative
                    findings), identification of heuristics (Complied/ Violated heuristic), usability impact (Small, Medium, High) and usability 
                    suggestion(s).

                    A high-fidelity prototype was constructed in Figma using the feedback and recommendations for improvement

                            from each other, with high visibility aiding the target audience of elderly people to quickly recognise buttons to 
                            move to the next screen.

                            The workout button in the "Home" screen was made more prominent to ensure that it is one of the first elements 
                            that is viewed by the user (Left), and a reset button was added to the "Workout" screen to allow users the control
                            and freedom to restart the exercise (Right). Accompanying this is a pause and fast forward button, icons that match 
                            real-world items and are therefore easily recognisable.

                Active Garden was constructed as a combination of two networked technologies: a mobile app and an automatic watering system. 
                It targets the concept of active aging by encouraging elderly people to improve their physical and mental health, as well as 
                promoting social participation and conversation with their peers through Active Garden’s “Friends” screen, where daily streaks 
                and progress can be compared. By involving gardening, a popular hobby among the elderly, the target audience is provided more 
                incentive to live a healthier lifestyle. Essentially, this project enhanced my understanding of user research and usability testing, 
                and how to utilise feedback from participants to improve prototypes. As quoted by stakeholders, I pertained “Good follow up from the 
                user feedback” when creating the final prototype.
