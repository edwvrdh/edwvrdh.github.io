                        This case study encompasses the concept of supporting better experiences for commuting. That is, the overarching objective 
                        was to design a digital solution that supports positive or desirable user experiences in the context of commuting. To approach 
                        this, my design team and I decided that the most appropriate demographic to target was young adult commuters. Particularly, 
                        we targeted young adults who would regularly travel via trains, with typical trips lasting up to an hour. <br><br>
    
                        This target demographic was chosen as it best demonstrates the dullness of a typical commuting experience, with long
                        travel times encouraging young adults to look towards utilising digital solutions to improve their monotonous experience. 
                        Ultimately, as commuting is a pivotal aspect for many people, it is essential to design for desirable user 
                        experiences for individuals whilst they travel. In doing so, commuters will be influenced to maintain a more positive 
                        attitude and outlook whilst travelling on the train, which can extend to other aspects of a commuterâ€™s daily life.

                        My main roles for this project included being a user researcher and one of the key contributors to the user-experience 
                        evaluation process, which involved roleplaying as the user persona and conducting experience prototyping. Through my 
                        contributions, the team was able to produce a believable persona that depicted a typical young adult commuter, as well 
                        as collect key information from user experience journals to improve the various prototypes that we had developed. Artefacts 
                        showcased include my contributions to the final project as well as my prototype concepts that were not included within 
                        the final deliverables but are demonstrated to further explore my thought processes as a designer.
