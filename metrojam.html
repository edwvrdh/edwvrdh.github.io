                    This case study encompasses the concept of supporting better experiences for commuting. That is, the overarching objective 
                    was to design a digital solution that supports positive or desirable user experiences in the context of commuting. To approach 
                    this, my design team and I decided that the most appropriate demographic to target was young adult commuters. Particularly, 
                    we targeted young adults who would regularly travel via trains, with typical trips lasting up to an hour. <br><br>

                    This target demographic was chosen as it best demonstrates the dullness of a typical commuting experience, with long
                    travel times encouraging young adults to look towards utilising digital solutions to improve their monotonous experience. 
                    As commuting is a pivotal form of transport for many people, it is essential to design for desirable user 
                    experiences for individuals whilst they commute. In doing so, commuters will be influenced to maintain a more positive 
                    attitude and outlook whilst travelling on the train, which can extend to other aspects of a commuterâ€™s daily life.
