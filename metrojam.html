                        This case study encompasses the concept of supporting better experiences for commuting. That is, the overarching objective 
                        was to design a digital solution that supports positive or desirable user experiences in the context of commuting. To approach 
                        this, my design team and I decided that the most appropriate demographic to target was young adult commuters. Particularly, 
                        we targeted young adults who would regularly travel via trains, with typical trips lasting up to an hour. <br><br>
    
                        This target demographic was chosen as it best demonstrates the dullness of a typical commuting experience, with long
                        travel times encouraging young adults to look towards utilising digital solutions to improve their monotonous experience. 
                        Ultimately, as commuting is a pivotal aspect for many people, it is essential to design for desirable user 
                        experiences for individuals whilst they travel. In doing so, commuters will be influenced to maintain a more positive 
                        attitude and outlook whilst travelling on the train, which can extend to other aspects of a commuter’s daily life.

                        My main roles for this project included being a user researcher and one of the key contributors to the user-experience 
                        evaluation process, which involved roleplaying as the user persona and conducting experience prototyping. Through my 
                        contributions, the team was able to produce a believable persona that depicted a typical young adult commuter, as well 
                        as collect key information from user experience journals to improve the various prototypes that we had developed. 
                        Artefacts showcased include my contributions to the final project as well as my prototype concepts that were not 
                        included within the final deliverables but are demonstrated to further explore my thought processes as a designer.

                        The user persona I created for the design team showcases my ability to effectively interpret user research data 
                        to present key knowledge of a target demographic. In doing so, I provided the team with an artefact that collects 
                        the key insights of the interviews we conducted, representing characteristics, circumstances and aspects that relate 
                        to commuting experiences.

                        Technology and its use whilst commuting was a prominent topic that the majority of interviewees discussed. 
                        Therefore, it was apparent that it was beneficial to be included within the persona. In doing so, invaluable insight into digital 
                        solution opportunities is gathered. Using interview data, the consensus was that the interviewee would have their mobile 
                        device readily accessible whilst on the train and take quick glances at the train TV to check the stations. Through 
                        this, I deduced that I could use the train carriage’s environment and mobile devices as an opportunity 
                        to improve commuting experiences.
