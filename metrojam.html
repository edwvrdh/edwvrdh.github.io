                        This case study encompasses the concept of supporting better experiences for commuting. That is, the overarching objective 
                        was to design a digital solution that supports positive or desirable user experiences in the context of commuting. To approach 
                        this, my design team and I decided that the most appropriate demographic to target was young adult commuters. Particularly, 
                        we targeted young adults who would regularly travel via trains, with typical trips lasting up to an hour. <br><br>
    
                        This target demographic was chosen as it best demonstrates the dullness of a typical commuting experience, with long
                        travel times encouraging young adults to look towards utilising digital solutions to improve their monotonous experience. 
                        Ultimately, as commuting is a pivotal aspect for many people, it is essential to design for desirable user 
                        experiences for individuals whilst they travel. In doing so, commuters will be influenced to maintain a more positive 
                        attitude and outlook whilst travelling on the train, which can extend to other aspects of a commuter’s daily life.

                        My main roles for this project included being a user researcher and one of the key contributors to the user-experience 
                        evaluation process, which involved roleplaying as the user persona and conducting experience prototyping. Through my 
                        contributions, the team was able to produce a believable persona that depicted a typical young adult commuter, as well 
                        as collect key information from user experience journals to improve the various prototypes that we had developed. 
                        Artefacts showcased include my contributions to the final project as well as my prototype concepts that were not 
                        included within the final deliverables but are demonstrated to further explore my thought processes as a designer.

                        The user persona I created for the design team showcases how I am able to effectively interpret user research data 
                        to present key knowledge of a target demographic. In doing so, I provided the team with an artefact that collects 
                        the key insights of the interviews we conducted, representing characteristics, circumstances and aspects that relate 
                        to commuting experiences.

                        <br>
                        Technology and its use whilst commuting was a prominent topic that the majority of interviewees discussed. 
                        Therefore, it was apparent that it was beneficial to be included within the persona. In doing so, invaluable insight 
                        into digital solution opportunities is gathered. Using interview data, the consensus was that the interviewee would 
                        have their mobile device readily accessible whilst on the train and take quick glances at the train TV to check the 
                        stations. Through this, I deduced that I could use the train carriage’s environment and mobile devices as an 
                        opportunity to improve commuting experiences.

                        To adequately pinpoint user needs, I decided that generalising and representing the target audience’s goals was 
                        necessary. Interview participants stated their desires to kill time and remain settled as they travel. With music 
                        listening being the common solution to this desire, I felt that including it within the persona was crucial to 
                        accurately identifying commuter preferences.

                        My perception of the user data was that participants would become easily agitated by mild changes in 
                        their commutes. It seemed that, due to the lack of a distraction or something to ease their mind, commuters 
                        would become restless over things such as slower train paces and overhearing other people's conversations. 
                        By outlining these typical frustrations, greater opportunity to identify solutions to the pain points that 
                        an everyday commuter likely experiences are uncovered.

                        User research was further manipulated to produce a high-level journey map that demonstrates experiences that 
                        the target demographic would typically encounter when commuting. My aim when creating this artefact was to 
                        allow my team to ideate as many design solutions as possible by exploring various stages of a commuter's journey 
                        and identifying any pain points.

                        a succinct timeline that details the average commuting experience. When deciding on what content was to be used
                        for this section, I ensured that each dot point was beneficial to detailing possible pain points and design 
                        opportunities before, during and after a train ride, whilst also maintaining a clear, step-by-step timeline.

                        By including technology use based on user research data, I am able to deduce the digital mediums that I can 
                        use to produce a digital solution, fast-tracking the ideation process. That is, using mobile phones was a 
                        popular activity within the user research data, and therefore producing a solution that is easily accessible 
                        by phones may be a good idea. Showcasing major factors that influenced the typical commuting experience allowed 
                        me to easily distinguish aspects that need to be addressed, which is vital to develop an adequate digital solution.

                        audience. In addition to this, a social aspect was integrated as commuters tend to text whilst travelling.

                        When deciding my approach to building a low-fidelity wireframe of MetroJam, I had to consider how to best structure the 
                        application to accomodate for these key themes of music and socialising. Among others, the homepage, chat and favourites 
                        screen were sketched with this in mind and explored below.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="center-text">
                        My approach to the home screen was to provide quick access to the content that users would want to see the most. Therefore,
                        music that was currently playing was the first element on the page, with upcoming songs beneath it. The 'Discover' section
                        provides greater opportunity to delve into new music and refresh the commuter's listening experience. <br><br>

                        By implementing a 'Chat' screen, users can kill further time by socialising with other commuters within the same train.
                        Whether it be to discuss the song that is currently playing or general conversation, this page would cater for those
                        that like to message others whilst commuting.

                        The 'Favourites' page was implemented with the intention of providing a pleasant and uninterrupted listening experience

                        Deliberately placed around the region where users would rest their thumb, the "Now Playing" element is a persistent
                        button that allows the user to view the song that is currently playing. This was deliberately placed at the 
                        forefront of the screen for more efficent and usable interactions, after usability testing participants concluded that 
                        its previous positioning could be improved upon.

                            The social aspect of commuting that was detailed in the user research was another element that I wanted to 
                            address in this prototype. Specifically, I made sure to capitalise on opportunities that would promote commuter 
                            interactions in the MetroJam app, as shown by the chat box at the bottom of the expanded “Now Playing” screen. 
                            I felt that this would be a great addition to this screen as not only does it provide quick access to the Chat 
                            page, but it also provides users with live reactions to the song that is currently playing without ever having 
                            to leave the “Now Playing” screen by previewing the latest message.

                        Ultimately, this project aims to enhance the commuting experience of a typical young adult by targeting pain 
                        points such as tedious travel times, distracting surroundings, and boredom. By simply scanning or entering 
                        a QR code provided within train carriages into the MetroJam app, users can sit back and jam to trendy tunes 
                        and new genres that fellow commuters are listening to. If a user decides that they want to keep using their 
                        phone as they travel, they can freely discuss the music and other related topics with other MetroJam users on 
                        their train using the Chat feature.
