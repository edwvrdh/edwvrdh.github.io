                        This case study encompasses the concept of supporting better experiences for commuting. That is, the overarching objective 
                        was to design a digital solution that supports positive or desirable user experiences in the context of commuting. To approach 
                        this, my design team and I decided that the most appropriate demographic to target was young adult commuters. Particularly, 
                        we targeted young adults who would regularly travel via trains, with typical trips lasting up to an hour. <br><br>
    
                        This target demographic was chosen as it best demonstrates the dullness of a typical commuting experience, with long
                        travel times encouraging young adults to look towards utilising digital solutions to improve their monotonous experience. 
                        Ultimately, as commuting is a pivotal aspect for many people, it is essential to design for desirable user 
                        experiences for individuals whilst they travel. In doing so, commuters will be influenced to maintain a more positive 
                        attitude and outlook whilst travelling on the train, which can extend to other aspects of a commuter’s daily life.

                        My main roles for this project included being a user researcher and one of the key contributors to the user-experience 
                        evaluation process, which involved roleplaying as the user persona and conducting experience prototyping. Through my 
                        contributions, the team was able to produce a believable persona that depicted a typical young adult commuter, as well 
                        as collect key information from user experience journals to improve the various prototypes that we had developed. 
                        Artefacts showcased include my contributions to the final project as well as my prototype concepts that were not 
                        included within the final deliverables but are demonstrated to further explore my thought processes as a designer.

                        The user persona I created for the design team showcases how I am able to effectively interpret user research data 
                        to present key knowledge of a target demographic. In doing so, I provided the team with an artefact that collects 
                        the key insights of the interviews we conducted, representing characteristics, circumstances and aspects that relate 
                        to commuting experiences.

                        Technology and its use whilst commuting was a prominent topic that the majority of interviewees discussed. 
                        Therefore, it was apparent that it was beneficial to be included within the persona. In doing so, invaluable insight 
                        into digital solution opportunities is gathered. Using interview data, the consensus was that the interviewee would 
                        have their mobile device readily accessible whilst on the train and take quick glances at the train TV to check the 
                        stations. Through this, I deduced that I could use the train carriage’s environment and mobile devices as an 
                        opportunity to improve commuting experiences.

                        To adequately pinpoint user needs, I decided that generalising and representing the target audience’s goals was 
                        necessary. Interview participants stated their desires to kill time and remain settled as they travel. With music 
                        listening being the common solution to this desire, I felt that including it within the persona was crucial to 
                        accurately identifying commuter preferences.

                        My perception of the user data was that participants would become easily agitated by mild changes in 
                        their commutes. It seemed that, due to the lack of a distraction or something to ease their mind, commuters 
                        would become restless over things such as slower train paces and overhearing other people's conversations. 
                        By outlining these typical frustrations, greater opportunity to identify solutions to the pain points that 
                        an everyday commuter likely experiences are uncovered.

                        User research was further manipulated to produce a high-level journey map that demonstrates experiences that 
                        the target demographic would typically encounter when commuting. My aim when creating this artefact was to 
                        allow my team to ideate as many design solutions as possible by exploring various stages of a commuter's journey 
                        and identifying any pain points.

                        I reflected the typical actions, thoughts and emotions represented from our user data results into 
                        a succinct timeline that details the average commuting experience. When deciding on what content was to be used
                        for this section, I ensured that each dot point was beneficial to detailing possible pain points and design 
                        opportunities before, during and after a train ride, whilst also maintaining a clear, step-by-step timeline.

                        popular activity within the user research data, and therefore producing a solution that is easily accessible 
                        by phones may be a good idea. Showcasing major factors that influenced the typical commuting experience allowed 
                        me to easily distinguish aspects that need to be addressed, which is vital to develop an adequate digital solution.

                        can be produced in relation to the design brief, but it also makes connections with the other aspects of the journey

                        After analysing and discussing the user research data with the team, it was decided that the design solution was to 
                        involve music as the primary focus due to its popularity within interviews and its accessibility among the target 
                        audience. In addition to this, a social aspect was integrated as commuters tend to text whilst travelling.

                        When deciding my approach to building a low-fidelity wireframe of MetroJam, I had to consider how to best structure the 
                        application to accomodate for these key themes of music and socialising. Among others, the homepage, chat and favourites 
                        screen were sketched with this in mind and explored below.  
                    </p>

                    <p class="center-text">
                        My approach to the home screen was to provide quick access to the content that users would want to see the most. Therefore,
                        music that was currently playing was the first element on the page, with upcoming songs beneath it. The 'Discover' section
                        provides greater opportunity to delve into new music and refresh the commuter's listening experience. <br><br>

                        By implementing a 'Chat' screen, users can kill further time by socialising with other commuters within the same train.
                        Whether it be to discuss the song that is currently playing or general conversation, this page would cater for those
                        that like to message others whilst commuting.
