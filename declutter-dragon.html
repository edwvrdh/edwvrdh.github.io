                <br><br>
                This capstone project encourages regular decluttering and organising habits among its users, with the addition of a 
                digital photo frame device aiming to extend these habits over the long-term. Adhering to a Lean UX approach to design, this 
                MVP-level product was developed with a team of 5 over the course of 3 months.

                <br><br>
                In a post-COVID age, more than ever before, it is important to support or help people through the use of technology to 
                improve their quality of life at home. It is difficult and daunting for many individuals to stay on top of their organising
                and decluttering habits, especially in the long-term.
                <br><br>
                Currently, decluttering apps struggle to address this problem.

                With a Lean UX approach, quick iterations of paper prototypes and wireframes were constructed. The following artefacts are my contributions to this stage,
                demonstrating the key features: decluttering and inventory management.

                Transitioning to a mid-fi prototype, features were added, modified and scrapped various times, as is expected in a Lean UX approach.
                In addition to this, internal and external usability testing and heuristic evaluation on the functionality was conducted to further improve the 
                prototype.

            In addition to continued experimentation of the general UI of the app, my focus for this sprint was to ensure that

                <b>Flow of the Routine Screens</b><br>
                Many of the feedback/ insights denoted the confusing navigation of the routine screens. With inspiration from the 
                Calendar app to ensure a sense of external consistency, the routine screens were much more centralised and easier 
                to navigate.

                <b>Improving Mascot Interactivity</b><br>
                To better justify the inclusion of a mascot and improve its connection with the other features, a mascot hub was prioritised 
                in the homepage, with its mood, the user's streak, badges and accessories being dictated by the user's completion of their routines.

            After more user testing as a part of a fieldy study conducted in this sprint, further improvements were needed concerning the UI, as
            users were still overwhelmed by certain screens, including the homepage and routine creation screen.

                Many changes were made to the prototype in this stage to emphasis a focus on organising and decluttering. As a result, the inventory 
                system and the social aspect were removed, with the latter being replaced with a quests page.

                <b>Help & Documentation</b><br>
                To improve learnability and reduce confusion among interactions, a tutorial was implemented for first time users of the routine 
                screens, which also provided another opportunity for the mascot to come into play.

                Working in tandem with the app, with visual and auditory cues to remind users to begin their scheduled routines, the device
                acted as a standard digital photo frame that displays photos. When an alert or a routine is about to begin, these photos will
                be disrupted and will not return until the user finishes the current task.
