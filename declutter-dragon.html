                <br><br>
                This capstone project encourages regular decluttering and organising habits among its users, with the addition of a 
                digital photo frame device aiming to extend these habits over the long-term. Adhering to a Lean UX approach to design, this 
                MVP-level product was developed with a team of 5 over the course of 3 months.

                <br><br>
                In a post-COVID age, more than ever before, it is important to support or help people through the use of technology to 
                improve their quality of life at home. It is difficult and daunting for many individuals to stay on top of their organising
                and decluttering habits, especially in the long-term.
                <br><br>
                Currently, decluttering apps struggle to address this problem.

                In addition to this, internal and external usability testing and heuristic evaluation on the functionality was conducted to further improve the 
                prototype.

            In addition to continued experimentation of the general UI of the app, my focus for this sprint was to ensure that

                <b>Flow of the Routine Screens</b><br>
                Many of the feedback/ insights denoted the confusing navigation of the routine screens. With inspiration from the 
                Calendar app to ensure a sense of external consistency, the routine screens were much more centralised and easier 
                to navigate.

                <b>Improving Mascot Interactivity</b><br>
                To better justify the inclusion of a mascot and improve its connection with the other features, a mascot hub was prioritised 
                in the homepage, with its mood, the user's streak, badges and accessories being dictated by the user's completion of their routines.

            After more user testing as a part of a fieldy study conducted in this sprint, further improvements were needed concerning the UI, as
            users were still overwhelmed by certain screens, including the homepage and routine creation screen.

                Many changes were made to the prototype in this stage to emphasis a focus on organising and decluttering. As a result, the inventory 
                system and the social aspect were removed, with the latter being replaced with a quests page.

                To improve learnability and reduce confusion among interactions, a tutorial was implemented for first time users of the routine

                Working in tandem with the app, with visual and auditory cues to remind users to begin their scheduled routines, the device
                acted as a standard digital photo frame that displays photos of the user's choice. When an alert or a routine is about to 
                begin, these photos will be disrupted and will not return until the user finishes the current task.

                Made key changes to the Routine-in-Progress screen (middle) to visually show each task in the specific routine they are completing, 
                including  the current task and the tasks that are next. In addition to this, a vital Completion screen was added once a routine 
                is completed to reward the user with changes in their streak, mascot mood and rewards.

                    Essentially, working on Declutter Dragon has provided me with valuable insights into the Lean UX process to design, with 
                    key principles such as "permission to fail" and "making over analysing" being major factors that have stuck by me
                    after these 3 months. After many pivots in the features to adequately improve mental well-being in the home, including
                    inventory management, community tab and other adjustements that concluded with an emphasis on solely organising and
                    decluttering, such principles of Lean UX were heavily experienced and pursued with satisfaction.

                    If I were given the opportunity to redo this project, I would ensure that a shared understanding and constant 
                    collaboration witht the team was maintained throughout all stages of design process, which was something that I 
                    initally struggled with in the early weeks of the project.
