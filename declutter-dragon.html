                <br><br>
                This capstone project encourages regular decluttering and organising habits among its users, with the addition of a 
                digital photo frame device aiming to extend these habits over the long-term. Adhering to a Lean UX approach to design, this 
                MVP-level product was developed with a team of 5 over the course of 3 months.

                <br><br>
                In a post-COVID age, more than ever before, it is important to support or help people through the use of technology to 
                improve their quality of life at home. It is difficult and daunting for many individuals to stay on top of their organising
                and decluttering habits, especially in the long-term.
                <br><br>
                Currently, decluttering apps struggle to address this problem.

                With a Lean UX approach, quick iterations of paper prototypes and wireframes were constructed. The following artefacts are my contributions to this stage,
                demonstrating the key features: decluttering and inventory management.

                Emphasising the concept of suggesting what to declutter based on the time that the user has to spare, which was an interesting
                take-away that the team came up with after the market analysis (Top-left corner and bottom-right corner).

                Creating a much clearer sequence of screens, where the user begins with adding rooms in the introductory screens. They then
                move on to create their regular routines, where tasks can be added within them.

                Transitioning to a mid-fi prototype, features were added, modified and scrapped various times, as is expected in a Lean UX approach. 
                In addition to this, internal and external user testing and heuristic evaluation on the functionality was conducted to further improve the 
                prototype.
